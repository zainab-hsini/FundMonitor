# FundMonitor: Crowdfunding Campaign Data Scraper & Analysis

## Project Overview

FundMonitor is a Python project that scrapes data from the crowdfunding platform Chuffed.org, which hosts campaigns to raise funds for social, community, and charitable causes. The primary goal of this scraper is to extract data related to active campaigns and analyze the performance based on:

- Categories (e.g., Community, Environment, Refugees and Asylum Seekers)
- Locations (e.g., Canada, Australia, United States, United Kingdom)

The program calculates and compares:

- The average money raised per category and location
- The average fund percentage achieved per category and location
- The average money raised per day per category and location

The results provide insights into the most successful categories and locations for fundraising, making it useful for organizations or individuals interested in understanding which types of campaigns perform the best.

## Purpose

The main purpose of FundMonitor is to provide an analysis of the best-performing crowdfunding campaigns based on category and location. By scraping and analyzing this data, the project aims to:

- Identify trends in fundraising success
- Highlight the best categories and locations for fundraising
- Provide data-driven insights to campaigners for optimizing their strategies

## Website

The data is scraped from Chuffed.org, a popular crowdfunding platform focused on social impact projects. Chuffed.org was chosen because it hosts a wide variety of campaigns related to community and social projects, making it an ideal source for analyzing trends across different regions and campaign types.
