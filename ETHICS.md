# Ethical Considerations in Web Scraping

## Purpose of Data Collection

The primary purpose of our project, FundMonitor, is to collect data on the performance of social causes in terms of funds raised, geographical trends, and the pace of fundraising. By gathering this data, we aim to identify patterns and trends that can inform nonprofits, donors, and social researchers. The insights gained will help optimize fundraising strategies and provide a better understanding of which causes are receiving the most public attention and support.

## Why Are We Collecting This Data?

This data is being collected strictly for **educational and research purposes**. The goal is to enhance the understanding of fundraising trends and provide actionable insights that can help organizations, philanthropists, and other stakeholders focus their efforts on the most impactful causes. We are not using the data for commercial purposes or for profit-driven activities. Our analysis is aimed at helping the social impact sector make informed decisions that benefit the public good.

## Collection Practices

We follow ethical web scraping practices to ensure that our activities do not cause any harm or disruption to the website we collect data from:

- **One-Time Scraping per Execution**: Our program is designed to scrape data only once per execution, ensuring that it does not extract data frequently or at short intervals. This minimizes the potential load on the websiteâ€™s infrastructure.
- **Respect for Restrictions**: We do not bypass password protection, paywalls, or other restricted areas of the website. Our scraping is limited to publicly accessible pages only.
- **Compliance with Terms of Service**: Section 4.24(f) of the Chuffed.org terms of service prohibits activities that impose an "unreasonably large load" on their infrastructure. We take this seriously and ensure that our scraping activities are light and do not overburden the website.

## Data Usage, Handling, and Privacy

- **No Collection of Personal Information**: We do not collect any personal data. The data collected is focused entirely on fundraising statistics, such as the total amounts raised and the geographical locations of campaigns.
- **Secure Data Storage**: We do not store any data.
